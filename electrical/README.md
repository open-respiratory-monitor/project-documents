Electrical designs of custom circuit boards, wiring schematics, etc.

The PCB_Files folder contains the Gerber circuitboard files needed to purchase and order the flowmeter board to interface the Adafruit LPS33HW pressure sensors to the airway.

The flowmeter PCB was designed by Michelle Gabutti (MIT). 

We are grateful for the open-source circuit diagrams for the pressure sensors and other components from Adafruit which can be found on their website: www.adafruit.com
